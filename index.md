## About Me

Iâ€™m currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, supervised by Prof. [Yansong Tang](https://andytang15.github.io/) and Prof. [Jiwen Lu](https://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/). My recent research focuses on 3D vision and its intersection with Robotics and AIGC.

Prior to my PhD, I received a bachelor from the [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am also a member of Class of General Artificial Intelligence of Tsinghua University. In my undergraduate research, I am fortunate to work with [Yueqi Duan](https://duanyueqi.github.io/) at the Department of Electronic Engineering of Tsinghua University. We have great collaborations working on 3D reconstruction.
